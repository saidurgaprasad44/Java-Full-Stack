 * Responsibilities:
 * - Read unpublished events from Outbox table
 * - Publish events to Kafka
 * - Mark events as published

 * Pattern Implemented:
 * - Transactional Outbox Pattern
 *
 * Why?
 * Orders and events must be persisted together
 * in a single database transaction. This publisher
 * asynchronously sends stored events to Kafka,
 * ensuring database and messaging consistency.
