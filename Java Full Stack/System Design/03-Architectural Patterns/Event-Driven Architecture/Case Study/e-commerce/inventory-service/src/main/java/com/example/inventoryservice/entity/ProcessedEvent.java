/**
 * ==========================================
 * Stores Processed Kafka Events
 * ==========================================
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Track successfully processed events
 * - Prevent duplicate event processing
 *
 * Pattern Implemented:
 * - Idempotent Consumer Pattern
 *
 * When a Kafka event is processed successfully,
 * its eventId is stored in this table.
 *
 * If the same event is received again,
 * processing is skipped.
